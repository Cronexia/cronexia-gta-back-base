# 📚 DTOs / Data Transfer Objects

Some explainations, along with ressources, explaining DTO's, their differences, their utilisation & implementations.

## Different types of DTOs

DTO, Data Transfer Object, are a way to send/receive informations ,usually in the `JSON` format, and can refer to:

- an Entity
- a Model
- a DTO

However, there are some differences

### Entity refers to 💾 Database

Used to define columns/fields in the database, and must correspond to database structure

👷 Exemple: In PostgreSQL : id, firstname, lastname, date_of_birth

### Model refers to 🚦 Backend

In particular to services, also known as business logic.

It refers to database fields expose from the back office, but also those fields can be

- transformed
- merged
- 🛑 validated
  - *from the DTO ?*

👷 Exemple: In NestJs:

- id
- firstname
- lastname
- *fullname* // `${firstname} ${lastname}`
- *age* // ~`now() - date_of_birth`

### DTO refers to 🖼️ Front

What is accessible from the users (web or through APIs), both in ⬇️ gathering (`GET`) or ⬆️ input (`POST`, `PATCH`, etc.)

👷 Exemple : in GraphQL: id, fullname, age

Can (and should) also be 🛑 validated, through > `class-transformer` > ~= `@IsString()` / `@IsNumber()` / etc.

This ensure incoming data is properly formatted to be added to the database.

#### ⬇️ Gathering steps, GET

1. Entity (database) > Gather datas from the databases
2. Model (Back)      > Formatting the object to return
3. DTO (Front)       > Validation & (partial) providing

#### ⬆️ Input steps, POST

1. Client sends raw datas (JSON)
2. DTO (Front)       > Validation (format, types), parse
3. Model (Back)      > Transformations, database structure matching through entity
4. Entity (database) > Database insertion

#### ♻️ ~Redondant code

Some developpers strictly uses the same 💾 Entity and 🚦 Model and they think the data structure should be the same everywhere.

It can happens than both get merged, through conversion packages, or automation ("auto mapping").

   1. **Entities/Models/Schemas** are classes defined on the **ORM** (TypeORM, Mongoose, Prisma etc) level.
      The ORM will use the defined schemas to communicate with your ✅**database**.
   2. **DTOs** are classes defined on the **controller** and **service** level, where the logic happens.
      ORM doesn’t use the DTOs to communicate with your ❌**database**.
