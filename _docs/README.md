# Project documentation

Dedicated folder for project documentation.

Too often we work on the side of the project and most traces are lost.

Here are 3 main documentations:

- [Local environnement setup](./local-environnement-setup.md) to learn how to contribute to the project
- `/craft-and-tests` folder, where you can create others docs or folders to test stuff, or store your work in progress
- `/debug` folder, where you can store all the obscure stuff you did until it worked
